# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is a software that was created so that software developers can collaberate on a project. The users can be all over the word and from their terminal, they can save and upload their documents/code to sites, like github,  that use the git software. Then another user can pull that saved document/code and view and/or change and/or download and/or many other things. Github is one of many webistes who use the software git and have devoloped a site that helps manage and host the projects developers are working on. 

Researched answer: I did a quick google for git vs git hub. the site dev mountain stated it as,
 "So, taken all together: Git vs. GitHub… what’s the difference? Simply put, Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them. "  I also googled, "what is GIT." the result from git-scm.com is "Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency."

 My reasearched definintion would be: Git is a free open source system design, "version control system," created for developers to collaberate and work on projects. Where as github is a webiste/service that is cloudbased that allows the developers/team to manage and maintain ther projects.


2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer:
A boolean value is true or false. So if you are looking for JavaScript to return a True or False you could use "< > === !== == !=" . An example could be somethning like 3 + 4 === 8. the result would be false. 
Researched answer:
A Boolean value is a data type, just like a number or a string. The Boolean data type, used in conditional statements, is deciding wether or not a statement is true or false and printing that statement. To get a Boolean datatype in Javascript, a user woud use "< > === !== == !=". An example could be somethning like 3 + 4 === 8. the result would be false. 

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer:In java script an index is a place within a string, like a street address. strings are zero indexed meaning that the first place in the string is index 0 and then moving to the right the next place would be 1 and continue on for the length of the string. -1 would be nothing/non-existent because it starts with 0. 
When using JavaScript, a value in a string is whatever is located at a specific index. An example of index vs value could be: 
var awesome =  "Clifford Roecker"
If you wanted to know what value was located at index 2, and have that shown in your terminal, you could use the expression console.log(awesome(2)).
The result would be => i
It is "i" because the value at index 0 is C, the value at index 1 is l, and the value at index 3 is i. 

Researched answer:
I believe my answer was pretty good. 

4. What is iteration? 
h was done by using a loop was a pivital turning point in the war. 

Your answer:Iteration, is a term that pertains to loops. Iteration is the act of doing something over and over multiple times until a solution is found/condition is met, and a loop is how we do it. During WWII, Nazi Germany had a secret code that would change daily and that is how they communicated over radio without other Countries knowing what they were saying. The machine that the German forces would use to decipher this code was called the "Enigma Machine." The machine was like a typewriter and if you pushed a key, it would type a letter. Except it had cables in the front that could be moved and if you placed in differnet plug holes. If a cable was placed in a different location, when you pushed a letter the result would be different. It was nearly impossible to decipher their code, even if you had an Enigma Machine. The code is eventually cracked by using a loop on a plug board. At first the number of iterations needed to crack the code was so high that it would take forever. But someone realized that every morning the germans first message started with the same phrase and ended with the phrase "Heil Hitler."
Beause the code breakers now knew multiple letters and their corresponding wires and plugs, that meant that the code breaking machine did not have to perform so many iterations and they could crack the daily cipher much quicker. The "Breaking of Enigma" whic

I think my answer was pretty good. 


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming is the act of multiple developers working on a project together and taking turns and doing different parts. The technique that I use at Learn is the "driver and Navigator" technique. The concept is that if there were 2 people, one person would be a driver and the other a navigator, and after a certain amount of time, they would us git to share the work that was done and switch roles. The driver would share their screen and  be the person typing the code, where as the navigator would be watching the drivers screen and possibly have another windown open doing research and instructing the Driver. Both parties talk and can discuss the possible plans of attack. Depending on the parties skill levels the jobs of both parties could be more or less hands off. For example, the task is to make a basic website and the pair were given a template and design sheet. A pair beginner developers could be staying together and going line for line and working through the code. Where as if it was a pair of more senior Devolopers, The driver could start knocking out the html framework while the navigator is looking for the colors of fonts and getting image links and other things like that prepared so when the driver gets to needing that kind of stuff the navigor can just say something like, font size for the heading is 54px color is (124, 15, 0), and so on. 

Researched answer: My answer would be pretty much the same but I now know there is other pair programming styles/techinques, such as backseat navigator, tour guide, ping pong pairing. The most important part of the pair programming is that participants switch roles. There are many benefits to this,  giving a person a break from a role and having them do something else prevents burning out or exhaustion. Another benefit is seeing how someone elses brain goes about a problem and learning from them, it maybe a keyboard shortcut or just the fact that someone approaches things differently which in the longrun is easier. The users can learn from eachother. An example is that I used to, when starting a site, would layout the HTML outline and then fill it all in with content and then go to the CSS file and do that part. I worked with my brother on a site and realized he starts off by going to the a css file and making a design file and doing fonts and sizes and colors and backround colors and assingin them things. If he and i were to make the same website, he would be done in like 1/5 of the time. I now love that style and use it myself.
